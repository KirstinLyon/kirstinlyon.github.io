    "section": "",
    "text": "This demonstration presents a Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into TB/HIV coinfection trends and treatment outcomes at a yearly level. Developed in collaboration with the USAID team in Mozambique, this dashboard leverages publicly available data from the data.pepfar.gov website (until its recent decommissioning). The analysis focuses on key PEPFAR indicators, including TB_STAT (TB status of HIV patients), TB_STAT_POS (HIV patients with a positive TB status), and TB_ART (HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy who are also receiving TB treatment).\nThe original dataset available to the USAID team included additional disaggregates such as age, sex, partner organization, and health facilities, as well as distinctions between new and existing cases. These granular details allow for a more nuanced understanding of the data, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation. While TB_STAT and TB_STAT_POS were historically reported quarterly, and TB_ART was reported quarterly until 2022 (transitioning to yearly reporting thereafter), this dashboard consolidates the data at a yearly level to provide a high-level overview of trends and performance over time.\nBuilt using Tableau, this dashboard is based on a prototype originally created with the Mozambique USAID team. It serves as an example of how BI tools can transform complex datasets into actionable insights for public health decision-making. By visualizing critical metrics and disaggregated data at a yearly level, the dashboard empowers health program managers, policymakers, and stakeholders to monitor program performance, identify disparities, and develop evidence-based strategies to combat TB/HIV coinfection. This tool is particularly valuable in resource-limited settings, where data-driven decisions can significantly improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The HIV Sub-National Estimates Viewer is a tool used to visualize and analyze estimates of HIV prevalence, incidence, and other related indicators at a sub-national level. It allows users to explore data and gain insights into the distribution of HIV across different regions within a country or territory. This viewer typically provides interactive maps, charts, and tables to present the data in a user-friendly format.\nThis tutorial walks through the process of recreating the HIV Sub-National Estimates Viewer using R and Tableau, with the aim of enabling individual analysis and expanding the functionalities of the viewer.\nGetting started:\n\nShape file (e.g. Global Administrative Areas - GADM)\nDataset from HIV Sub-National Estimates Viewer (https://naomi-spectrum.unaids.org/)\n\nShapefile for DR Congo\nThe DR Congo shapefile comprises three hierarchical levels: Country, Province, and Territory/Town. The “engtype 2” field distinguishes between territories and towns. Going forward, I’ll denote territories as districts.\nDownload data from HIV Sub-National Estimates Viewer\nChoose from the options provided below. Make sure to toggle between view types and table options as indicated.\n\n    \n\nAfter completing all selections (and ensuring “Table” is chosen), you will observe the following. Click on the CSV icon to initiate the data download.\n\n    \n\nThe data is presented in an organized manner by level, a crucial aspect for establishing the hierarchy. It’s important not to modify this arrangement before importing the data into R. The dataset comprises four levels, but only three will be utilized in Tableau, aligning with the three levels present in the shapefile.\n\n    \n\n\nPrepare Data using R\n\nBelow is an example of importing libraries, setting paths, and creating placeholders for additional columns based on the selected data from the HIV sub-national estimates viewer\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(zoo)   \n\n#---- GLOBAL \n\nPATH &lt;-  \"Data/dr_congo_level3_ART_coverage_all.csv\" \nOUTPUT &lt;- \"Dataout/\" \nAGE &lt;- \"All Ages\" \nSEX &lt;- \"Both\" \nINDICATOR &lt;- \"ART Coverage\"  \nPERIOD &lt;-  2022\n\nBelow is a function in R that converts a list of administrations into a hierarchy. In this example, Area Level 3 is selected, and “include all levels” is chosen in the Table Option. The function uses zoo package in R.\n\nclean_hierarchy &lt;- function(df) {\n    df %&gt;%\n        mutate(\n            level_name = paste(level, area, sep = \"_\"),\n            country = str_extract(level_name, \"^0_(.*)\"),\n            province = str_extract(level_name, \"^1_(.*)\"),\n            district = str_extract(level_name, \"^2_(.*)\"),\n            sub_district = str_extract(level_name, \"^3_(.*)\")\n        ) %&gt;%\n        mutate(\n            across(country:sub_district, ~ zoo::na.locf(.x, na.rm = FALSE))\n        ) %&gt;%\n        filter(!(province == level_name | district == level_name)) %&gt;%\n        mutate(\n            across(country:sub_district, ~ str_replace(.x, \"\\\\d+_\",\"\"))\n        ) %&gt;%\n        drop_na() \n}\nBelow is a function in R that can be used to create additional columns for combining datasets with different indicators, ages, or sexes. This function allows you to download separate datasets for each indicator (or age or sex) in Tableau and then combine them in R before importing them into Tableau.\nadd_columns &lt;- function(df, age, sex, indicator, period){\n    df %&gt;% \n        mutate(\n            age = age,\n            sex = sex, \n            indicator = indicator,\n            period = period\n        )\n}\n\nBelow is an example of how you can run the data through the clean_hierarchy function, create additional columns. It is important to check the names of provinces and districts against the shapefile from GADM. In this example, the district “Oïcha” is updated to “Oicha” to match the shapefile.\n\ndf &lt;- read_csv(PATH) %&gt;% \n    clean_hierarchy %&gt;% \n    add_columns(AGE, SEX, INDICATOR, PERIOD) %&gt;% \n    #different naming of district\n    mutate(district = case_when(district == \"Oïcha\" ~ \"Oicha\",\n                                .default = district)) %&gt;% \n    select(country, province, district, sub_district, \n           period, sex, age, indicator, lower, mean, upper)\n    write_csv(paste0(OUTPUT, \"spectrum.csv\"))\n\nThis is how the final dataset appears:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nRecreating the ART Coverage map in Tableau\n\n    \n\nImport Data\nThe spatial file is provided in a zipped format. Tableau does not require it to be unzipped, but if you choose to unzip it, ensure that the “.shp” file is placed in the same folder as the other spatial files.\nNote: Verify that the administration names from the HIV Sub-National Esimtates Viewer match those in the spatial file. It may be necessary to update the names in R before joining the data in Tableau.\nThe shapefile should be joined to the estimates data using the lowest level in the dataset. In this case, “Name 2” in the shapefile corresponds to “District” in the estimates data. The join is as follows:\n\n    \n\nCreate Layers\nMap layers can be created in Tableau using geometry (polygons) and points. Check all geographical elements you want to use are marked as spatial in Tableau (they should have a small globe). If they don’t, change the data type to geographic.\n\n    \n\nIf the data type does not correspond to a geographic role, then it should be modified.\n\n    \n\nAdd country (double-click). Ensure the mark type is map. Click on the Colour card and change the opacity to 0% and add a border.\n\n    \n\nUpdate Background Layers and set Washout to 100%. This removes the background from the map.\n\n    \n\nAdd Province\nTo include the province, drag it onto the canvas until “Marks Layer” is visible, then drop it. Confirm that the mark type is set to “map.”\n\n    \n\nTableau automatically interprets province and country data, eliminating the need for a shapefile. However, if you encounter the following error, it may be due to your computer settings.\n\n    \n\nClick on “unknown” and select Edit Locations.\n\n    \n\nYou can either specify the country directly (if it remains constant) or indicate a field containing the country information.\n\n    \n\nAdd Districts\nThis is where the “geometry” field from the shapefile comes into play. When Geometry is dragged as a layer, it appears as COLLECT(Geometry) in the marks shelf. Follow the same process as in step 2: drag until you see “add layer”. Ensure the mark type is set to “map”. Add the district name to detail, and apply mean to color. By default, it will be summed. If the district isn’t the lowest level, use avg(mean) instead of sum(mean).\n\n    \n\nChange the legend colour to Viridis. In the map below, null values appear as yellow. We want to remove nulls but keep the data relating to towns.\n\n    \n\nCreate a calculation to display districts without a value as white. To retain the ability to display towns, create the following calculation and place it in filters.\niif([Engtype 2] = \"Territory\" and \nisnull([Mean (Spectrum.Csv1)]), \"remove\", \"keep\")\nCreate a Map Layer for Towns\nCreate calculations for additional layers (then drag in similar to above). The Example below shows how to create a layer for towns. Set the mark type to circle, and add the calculation to text to show names.\niif([Engtype 2] = \"Town\", [Geometry], null)\n\n    \n\nInteracting with layers using the Layer Control\nThe Layer control can be used to toggle layers on and off by users. It appears when you hover over the top left hand corner of the map.\n\n    \n\nUsing parameters to control layers\nCreate a parameter control, then use the following calculation. [toggle: towns] is the name of the parameter, and [map layer: town] is the layer created for towns. Create the map layer using the calculation below:\niif([toggle: towns] = 1, [map layer: town], null)\n\nCreate the Dashboard\nDrag the worksheet containing the map to the dashboard, and add any parameters and filters.

    "text": "The next indicator we would like to introduce relates to the BCG Immunization coverage among one-year-olds by the WHO.\nThis indicator measures the percentage of infants who have received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is a vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). The indicator is calculated as the number of infants who have received BCG vaccine at birth divided by the total number of live births in a given time period, multiplied by 100. This indicator is important for assessing the coverage and effectiveness of BCG vaccination programs in reducing the burden of TB among infants and young children.\nTB disease mitigation through BCG vaccination is one of the main tools in the TB control programs. How are we faring in Southern, Eastern and Western regions of Sub Saharan Africa?\nRates of childhood immunization is a sensitive measure of basic healthcare access. Less than full population immunization coverage can be found in some of the most vulnerable communities where multiple dimensions of inequality and poverty co-exist. The BCG vaccine , given at birth , has a documented protective effect against meningitis and disseminated TB in children. BCG immunization does not prevent primary infection and, more importantly, does not prevent reactivation of latent pulmonary infection which is the main source of TB bacterial transmission in the community.\nIn the EAC, ECOWAS and SADC regions, coverage has varied over time yet remained consistently above 80%. Ensuing post-Covid19 data should provide some insight into the impact of the pandemic on the disruption on routine primary healthcare services such as childhood immunization programs.\n\n    \n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n    \n\nThe interactive version is available on Tableau Public.

The distinction between these two processes is significant since you may acquire TB infection but may experience TB disease only until much later. Globally, TB incidence is falling at about 2% per year and between 2015 and 2020 the cumulative reduction was 11%. This was over half way to the End TB Strategy milestone of 20% reduction between 2015 and 2020. An estimated 66 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2020. The various methods used to estimate incidence of TB disease, based on data availability and quality at a national level, are detailed in annual WHO reports."

TB mortality is an important indicator of the severity of the TB epidemic and the effectiveness of TB control programs.\n\nIn general, high TB mortality rates suggest inadequate TB control measures, while low rates indicate effective control efforts. TB mortality rates are often higher in low- and middle-income countries, where access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and care may be limited. To reduce TB mortality, the WHO recommends timely diagnosis and treatment of TB cases, including those with drug-resistant TB, as well as addressing the social determinants of TB, such as poverty, malnutrition, and poor living conditions.\nAlthough the Sustainable Development goals (Goal 3 Target3.3) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)(Target 6C Indicator 6.9) both programs specifically call for the end of communicable disease epidemics such as TB and HIV. The combined effects of advances in drug therapy, shortening of regimens, introduction of TB preventative therapy and strengthening of health services should make it easier for people to stay compliant on TB treatment and thus improve TB disease outcomes however, TB deaths have been slow to decline.\nOf particular concern was the effect of COVID19 on TB disease programs: Globally, TB deaths increased from the first time since 2005; 22.7mil children missed out on basic vaccinations in 2020; 92% of national health systems were disrupted at end 2021 and 115,500 precious healthcare workers were lost.

    "text": "Example Batch File\nA batch file is a script file containing a series of commands that are executed sequentially by the command interpreter on a computer system. In the Windows operating system, batch files typically have a “.bat” extension.\nBatch files are commonly used to automate repetitive tasks, perform system administration tasks, and run sequences of commands or programs without manual intervention. They are essentially text files containing a list of commands that would otherwise have to be entered individually at the command prompt.\n\nThe following batch file is used to automate the example R scripts.\nStart by defining your paths. Update the placeholder path below with the correct path to your Rscript.exe. Replace \"C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.3.3\\bin\\Rscript.exe\" with the actual path to your Rscript.exe, and \"C:\\Path\\to\\your\\R\\script.R\" with the path to your R script. This batch file will execute the specified R script using Rscript.exe. You can add more commands or scripts after the execution of the R script as needed.\nREM Define the path to Rscript executable \nset \"rscript=C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.3.3\\bin\\Rscript.exe\nWith this script, COMMON_PATH will be set to the directory where the batch file is located, assuming the batch file is in the same folder as your R scripts. If you want to set COMMON_PATH as an absolute path, uncomment the line and replace \"C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\R\\scripts\" with your desired absolute path.\nREM Get the directory of the batch file \nset \"batch_dir=%~dp0\"  \n\nREM Set the common path relative to the batch file location \nset \"common_path=%batch_dir%..\\Scripts\\\"  \n\nREM Replace the common path with an absolute path if needed REM \nset \"COMMON_PATH=C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\R\\scripts\"  \n\nREM Prints the common path to the console \necho %common_path%\nNext, specify the paths to your R scripts. In this example, all three files are located in the same folder, and the common path has been previously defined. However, if the R scripts are located in different folders, you can store their absolute paths directly here instead of creating a common path variable.\nREM Define the path to the R script \nset \"rscript_file1=%common_path%script_1.R\" \nset \"rscript_file2=%common_path%script_2.R\" \nset \"rscript_file3=%common_path%script_3.R\"\nRun the R scripts.\nREM Execute the R script \n\"%rscript%\" \"%rscript_file1%\" \n\"%rscript%\" \"%rscript_file2%\" \n\"%rscript%\" \"%rscript_file3%\"\nThe “pause” command prevents the console from closing, allowing you to view the output generated during the execution of the batch file. On the other hand, the “exit” command will close the console immediately after the batch file finishes executing.\nPAUSE\nTo execute, simply double-click the batch file (typically saved with a .bat extension)."

Tasks can be scheduled to run once, at a specified time and date, or on a recurring basis, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.\nTasks can also be triggered by specific events, such as when the computer starts up, when a user logs on, or when a particular system event occurs. Additionally, Task Scheduler provides options for configuring task settings, including specifying the user account under which the task will run, setting priority levels, and defining conditions for task execution.\nOverall, Windows Task Scheduler is a versatile tool that helps users automate routine tasks, improve productivity, and ensure that important processes are executed reliably and on schedule."

As of February 2023, there are 20152 indicators available for 299 regions/countries for 55 sources with data going back decades.\nThanks to Jesse Pilburn it it easy to access this large dataset by using his wbstats package in R. This article walks through how to use this package to download indicators.\nFirst, let’s install the wbstats package from GitHub:\nremotes::install_github(\"nset-ornl/wbstats\")\nNext load the libraries. The goal is to extract the data needed for further analysis in Tableau.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wbstats)\nCreate global variables.
