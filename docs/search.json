The indicator is calculated as the number of infants who have received BCG vaccine at birth divided by the total number of live births in a given time period, multiplied by 100. This indicator is important for assessing the coverage and effectiveness of BCG vaccination programs in reducing the burden of TB among infants and young children.\nTB disease mitigation through BCG vaccination is one of the main tools in the TB control programs. How are we faring in Southern, Eastern and Western regions of Sub Saharan Africa?\nRates of childhood immunization is a sensitive measure of basic healthcare access. Less than full population immunization coverage can be found in some of the most vulnerable communities where multiple dimensions of inequality and poverty co-exist. The BCG vaccine , given at birth , has a documented protective effect against meningitis and disseminated TB in children. BCG immunization does not prevent primary infection and, more importantly, does not prevent reactivation of latent pulmonary infection which is the main source of TB bacterial transmission in the community.\nIn the EAC, ECOWAS and SADC regions, coverage has varied over time yet remained consistently above 80%. Ensuing post-Covid19 data should provide some insight into the impact of the pandemic on the disruption on routine primary healthcare services such as childhood immunization programs.\n\n    \n\nLive Version\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n    \n\nThe interactive version is available on Tableau Public.

    "text": "The WHO (World Health Organization) defines TB mortality as\n\nthe number of deaths caused by tuberculosis (TB) among people with TB, regardless of their HIV status, per 100,000 population. TB mortality is an important indicator of the severity of the TB epidemic and the effectiveness of TB control programs.\n\nIn general, high TB mortality rates suggest inadequate TB control measures, while low rates indicate effective control efforts. TB mortality rates are often higher in low- and middle-income countries, where access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and care may be limited. To reduce TB mortality, the WHO recommends timely diagnosis and treatment of TB cases, including those with drug-resistant TB, as well as addressing the social determinants of TB, such as poverty, malnutrition, and poor living conditions.\nAlthough the Sustainable Development goals (Goal 3 Target3.3) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)(Target 6C Indicator 6.9) both programs specifically call for the end of communicable disease epidemics such as TB and HIV. The combined effects of advances in drug therapy, shortening of regimens, introduction of TB preventative therapy and strengthening of health services should make it easier for people to stay compliant on TB treatment and thus improve TB disease outcomes however, TB deaths have been slow to decline.\nOf particular concern was the effect of COVID19 on TB disease programs: Globally, TB deaths increased from the first time since 2005; 22.7mil children missed out on basic vaccinations in 2020; 92% of national health systems were disrupted at end 2021 and 115,500 precious healthcare workers were lost.
