<p>I am a data analyst with experience in Tableau, R, and Power BI. My work focuses on analysing and visualising data to support decision-making, particularly in the field of public health. I enjoy simplifying complex datasets and creating clear, informative visualisations that help others understand and use data effectively.</p>
