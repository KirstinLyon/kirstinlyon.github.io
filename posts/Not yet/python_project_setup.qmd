1.  create a repository on github

2.  Open visual code studio

3.  select option "Close git repository"

4.  select the project you want to clone, and add it to the correct local folder.

5.  Open the repository in Visual Code Studio

6.  create an environment for your project

    1.  open a terminal in VS Code (ctrl+shift+p - select "view: toggle terminal"
    2.  type: python -m venv .venv (this puts the virtual environment in your project)
    3.  type: .venv\\Scripts\\activate (to activate the virual environment)

    ```         
    If you get an error due to lack of permissions:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

    run in the command window instead

    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    This bypasses it one time - as a general rule, it's not allowed to execute scripts in this way
    ```

    ### Explanation:

    </div>

    -   PowerShell blocks scripts by default to prevent malicious code execution

    -   `RemoteSigned` allows local scripts (like your virtual environment activation) but requires downloaded scripts to be signed

    -   The `-Scope Process` change only affects your current PowerShell session

    -   The `-Scope CurrentUser` change persists but only affects your account

8.  after activating - look for this in your terminal

```         
(.venv) PS C:\path\to\project>
```

install the python extension - search in extensions bar for Python by microsoft

search for python: select interpreter and set it to .venv (this is the interpreter for your project)

check you are using the virtual environment:

```         
python -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix == sys.base_prefix)"
if returns FALSE - you are using the virual environment
```

look for a pyvenv.cnfg file in the directory - that means it's set up correctly

Setup a python project using cookiecutter datascience

```         
pip install cookiecutter
```

Open VS code and navigate to the folder you want your project to live in

file - open folder

If you have it on Git already -

clone repsotiry and put it where you want it

open terminal - ctrl + shift + p: view: toggle terminal

run requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt
