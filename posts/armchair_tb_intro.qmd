The Armchair Tuberculosis (TB) project is a collaboration between Dr Puni Mamdoo and Kirstin Lyon. Both interested in explaining Tuberculosis (TB) in Africa to non-experts using publicly available data.

Our aim is to introduce the key indicators used in the TB community as well as the status of TB within three regions in Sub-Saharan Africa: [East African Community (EAC](https://www.eac.int/)), [Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)](https://ecowas.int/) and [Southern African Development Community (SADC)](https://www.sadc.int/). These sub-continental views (regional views) are often not featured in global normative TB data analyses.

Data is collected and processed using R and presented using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). All R scripts and Tableau workbooks are freely available to download and reuse and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/KirstinLyon/Armchair-TB) and [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kirstin.lyon5886) respectively.
